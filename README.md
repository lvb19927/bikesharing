## Summary
To summarize the table even more than its been done, we can see that the CitiBike company should take into consideration that the majority of bike trips are less than 30 minutes. They should also consider the gender data that women, who make up less subscribesr and less users, are more likely to CitiBike in the main city area compared to men. Men tend to be the higher users especially during the work week and during the morning and evening rush hours.
